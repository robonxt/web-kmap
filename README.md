# Web K-Map Solver

A lightweight, dependency-free Karnaugh map solver that provides interactive visualization and Boolean function minimization for 2-4 variables. Features color-coded grouping, multiple solution display, and real-time synchronization between K-map and truth table views.

## What is a Karnaugh Map?

A Karnaugh map (K-map) is a graphical method for Boolean function simplification that reduces the need for extensive computation. Developed by Maurice Karnaugh in 1953, it uses adjacent squares in a grid to represent Boolean variables arranged in Gray code order, where adjacent cells differ by only one bit. By identifying and grouping adjacent 1's in powers of 2, K-maps allow quick identification of the minimal Boolean expression in sum-of-products (SOP) form.

## Implementation Notes

The solver follows this process:
1. Generates optimal Gray code layouts for 2-4 variables
2. Identifies all possible prime implicant groups
3. Finds minimal solutions using Quine-McCluskey algorithm
4. Extracts Boolean expressions from group patterns
5. Visualizes groups using dynamic SVG paths
6. Presents results in minimal SOP format

## Variable Notation

- Regular letter (A): Variable is 1 (TRUE)
- Overlined letter (A̅): Variable is 0 (FALSE)
- Example: A̅BC̅D means A=0, B=1, C=0, D=1

# Web K-Map Solver
A lightweight, dependency-free Karnaugh map solver for 2–4 variables. Instantly visualize, edit, and minimize Boolean functions with color-coded groups, real-time solutions, and a modern, mobile-friendly UI.

## What is a Karnaugh Map?
A Karnaugh map (K-map) is a graphical method for Boolean function simplification that reduces the need for extensive computation. Developed by Maurice Karnaugh in 1953, it uses adjacent squares in a grid to represent Boolean variables arranged in Gray code order, where adjacent cells differ by only one bit. By identifying and grouping adjacent 1's in powers of 2, K-maps allow quick identification of the minimal Boolean expression in sum-of-products (SOP) form.


## Features

### Core Functionality
- Interactive K-map grid with 2-4 variable support
- Real-time Boolean expression minimization
- Multiple solution display when available
- Don't care (X) condition support
- Synchronized truth table view
- Progressive Web App (PWA) support for offline use

### Visualization
- Color-coded term grouping
- Dynamic SVG group visualization
- Wraparound group highlighting
- Gray code and binary layout options
- Light/Dark theme support

### User Interface
- Intuitive cell state cycling (0 → 1 → X)
- Binary and decimal index display
- Tab-based view switching (K-Map / Truth Table)
- Mobile-responsive design
- PWA installation support for app-like experience
- One-click operations:
  - Set all cells to 1 or 0 (Clear)
  - Copy solution with proper notation
  - Toggle between K-map and Truth Table views
  - Toggle between Gray code and binary layouts
  - Toggle between light and dark themes
  - Toggle zero value visibility in cells (hide/show zeros)


## Usage Guide
1. **Variable Selection**
   - Choose 2-4 variables from the dropdown
   - Grid automatically adjusts to selected size
   - Variables are labeled A, B, C, D from most to least significant

2. **Cell Manipulation**
   - Click cells to cycle states: 0 → 1 → X
      > A blank cell (ㅤ) is also 0
   - Use quick actions to set all cells or clear
   - Use the "Hide Zeros" button to toggle whether zeros are shown or hidden in the grid and truth table
   - Watch real-time solution updates

3. **Solution Reading**
   - Results shown in minimal SOP form
   - Overlined variables (A̅) represent negation
   - Multiple solutions shown when available
   - Click copy button for formatted output

4. **Layout Options**
   - Toggle between Gray code and binary layouts
   - Gray code optimizes for adjacency
   - Binary shows traditional ordering


## Technical Details
- Built with vanilla HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript
- No external dependencies
- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities:
  - Offline functionality with service worker caching
  - Installable on desktop and mobile devices
  - App-like experience 
- Custom implementation of:
  - Quine-McCluskey algorithm for Boolean minimization
  - Gray code generation and handling
  - Prime implicant identification
  - Group visualization with SVG paths
- Real-time synchronization between K-map and Truth Table
- Vector-based UI elements for crisp display
- Responsive layout with CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Mobile-first design principles
- Theme system with CSS variables


## Implementation Notes
The solver follows this process:
1. Generates optimal Gray code layouts for 2-4 variables
2. Identifies all possible prime implicant groups
3. Finds minimal solutions using Quine-McCluskey algorithm
4. Extracts Boolean expressions from group patterns
5. Visualizes groups using dynamic SVG paths
6. Presents results in minimal SOP format


## Variable Notation
- Regular letter (A): Variable is 1 (TRUE)
- Overlined letter (A̅): Variable is 0 (FALSE)
- Blank cell (ㅤ): Also represents 0 (FALSE)
- Example: A̅BC̅D means A=0, B=1, C=0, D=1

## TODO:
- Try to get it working on browsers as old as Chrome 104+, Safari 12+. [Compare working features here](https://caniuse.com/?compare=chrome+104,safari+12&compareCats=CSS,HTML5,JS,JS%20API,Other,Security,SVG)
- ~~Get PWA working with a install button on mobile devices for a fullscreen, sandboxed webapp.~~ 
- Build working circuit diagram tab.
- ~~Toggle visibility of zero values in cells~~
- Modularize kmap-interface.js (IN PROGRESS)
- Fix K-map wraparound visualization for better edge and corner handling

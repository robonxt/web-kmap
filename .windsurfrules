We are building a lightweight Karnaugh map solver webapp. The tech used: html5, css3, minimal js, no external dependencies.

I want the following features:
A K-Map grid tab.
A Truth Table tab.
A Circuit tab.
A Help popup.
A solution container with copy to clipboard button that updates automatically and is shown in SOP format.
Full offline support.
PWA.

When adding description about the features, make sure to use the readme file as a reference, as well as the actual code itself, as the features listed previously may not be available in the current version.

Use boolean algebra to simplify terms.
Final answer should be a SOP (sum of products) format.


Network first caching, no versions, offline fallback. 
Try to use latest server version when online. 
Should work on http connections.
Update the readme to include features.
Update the info to concisely and clearly explain how to use the app. 
Make sure to include credits and links to the source code in the info.

Wires uses the Manhattan routing algorithm.

You should try to reuse existing code, styles, or logic where possible instead of creating new ones. Also try to optimize the code where possible.
